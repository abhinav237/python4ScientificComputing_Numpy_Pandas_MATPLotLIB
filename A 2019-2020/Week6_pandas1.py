# ## Pandas Series !
# A 1D array in numpy was called array !, which in pandas it is called a Series

# In[3]:

S1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4])
S2 = pd.Series([4,5,6, 0.1])
print(S2)


# In[4]:
# Converting a panda Series to a numpy array
S3=S1.to_numpy()
S4=S2.to_numpy()
S1.dtype
S2.dtype
S3.dtype
S4.dtype


# The vectorized operations are exactly like numpy arrays !!

# In[6]:


S3 = S1+S2
S4 = S1-S2
print(S3)


# You can also create logical Series (boolean)

# In[8]:


S5 = S1>S2
print(S5)


# You can also use the awesome logical indexing in pandas (similar to numpy)
# 

# In[9]:


S2[3]
S2[pd.Series([False,True,True,False])]


# In[ ]:


S1[S1>S2]


# The awesome thing about pandas is that you can give names to elements (we call them indexes)

# In[11]:


S6 = pd.Series([1,3,6,9],["a","b","c","d"])

# We can observe that it considers the indexes not the order !! that is a nice advantage !!

# Let's solve out problem using this advantage

# Q_heating = pd.Series([1150,1240,124], ["wall","ceiling", "door"])
# 
# or like this:
# 
# Q_heating = pd.Series([1150,1240,124], index= ["wall","ceiling", "door"])
# 
# Clearly, the second option is better because it is easier to understand
# 

# Furhtermore, you can define a pandas Series by providing a dictionary as the input
